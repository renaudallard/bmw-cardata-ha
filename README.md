# BMW CarData for Home Assistant

Turn your BMW CarData stream into native Home Assistant entities. This integration subscribes to the BMW CarData MQTT stream (or an optional custom MQTT broker), keeps the token fresh automatically, and creates sensors/binary sensors for every descriptor that emits data.

> **Note:** This base of the plugin was generated with the assistance of AI to quickly solve issues with the legacy implementation. The code is intentionally open—to-modify, fork, or build a new integration from it. PRs are welcome unless otherwise noted in the future.

> **Tested Environment:** Home Assistant 2025.3+ is required. Brand logos are included since HA 2026.3 via the `brand/` directory.

## Issues / Discussion
Please try to post only issues relevant to the integration itself on the [Issues](https://github.com/kvanbiesen/bmw-cardata-ha/issues) and keep all the outside discussion (problems with registration on BMWs side, asking for guidance, etc)

### Configure button actions
On the integration main page, there is now a "Configure" button. You can use it to:
- **Refresh authentication tokens** (always requests a new set of tokens from BMW, even when the current ones have not expired yet; will reload integration, might also need HA restart in some problem cases)
- **Start device authorization again** (redo the whole auth flow)
- **MQTT Broker** (switch stream source to a custom broker, including TLS mode and topic prefix)
- **Reset telemetry container** (delete and recreate the BMW telemetry container)
- **Clean up orphaned entities** (remove stale entities that no longer receive data)
- **Settings** (toggle optional features like Magic SOC, Charging History, Tyre Diagnosis, trip-end polling cooldown)

And manual API calls, these should be automatically called when needed, but if it seems that your device names aren't being updated, it might be worth it to run these manually.
- **Initiate vehicles (API)** (fetch all vehicle VINs on your account and create entities)
- **Get basic vehicle information (API)** (fetches vehicle details like model, series, etc. for all known VINs)
- **Get telematics data (API)** (fetches telematics data from the CarData API)

Note that every API call here counts towards your 50/24h quota!

### Removing a stale vehicle

If a vehicle is sold or removed from your BMW account but its device lingers in Home Assistant, delete it directly: **Settings → Devices & services → BMW CarData → the vehicle's device → Delete**. This only removes that one vehicle - other vehicles on the same account/config entry are unaffected. If BMW ever reports that VIN again, it's simply rediscovered like any new vehicle; nothing is permanently blocked.

# <u>Installation Instructions</u>


## BMW Portal Setup (DON'T SKIP, DO THIS FIRST - All Steps 1-13 before continuing)

The CarData web portal isn’t available everywhere (e.g., it’s disabled in Finland). You can still enable streaming by logging in by using supported region. It doesn't matter which language you select - all the generated Id and configuration is shared between all of them. 

**DO Steps 1-3 First before installing it in HACS**

### BMW 

- https://www.bmw.co.uk/en-gb/mybmw/vehicle-overview (in English)
- https://www.bmw.de/de-de/mybmw/vehicle-overview (in German)
- https://mybmw.bmwusa.com/ (USA we need testers or temp access)

### Mini

- https://www.mini.co.uk/en-gb/mymini/vehicle-overview (in English)
- https://www.mini.de/de-de/mymini/vehicle-overview (in German)

1. Select the vehicle you want to stream.
2. Choose **BMW CarData** or **Mini CarData**.
3. Generate a client ID as described here: https://bmw-cardata.bmwgroup.com/customer/public/api-documentation/Id-Technical-registration_Step-1
4. Under section CARDATA API, you see **Client ID**. Delete the original one and make a new one. Copy this new one to your clipboard because you will need it during **Configuration Flow** in Home Assistant.
   **Don't press the button Authenticate device (NEVER) **!!!!
5. Request access to **CarData API** first:
   - Click "Request access to CarData API"
   - ⏱️ **Wait 60 seconds** (BMW needs time to propagate permissions)
   Note, BMW portal seems to have some problems with scope selection. If you see an error on the top of the page, reload it, select one scope and wait for 120 seconds, then select another one and wait again.
6. Then request access to **CarData Stream**:
   - Click "Request access to CarData Stream"  
   - ⏱️ **Wait another 60 seconds**
   
   **Why?** BMW's backend needs time to activate permissions. Rushing causes 403 errors.
   
7. Scroll down to **CARDATA STREAMING** and press **Configure data stream** and on that new page, load all descriptors (keep clicking “Load more”).
8. Manually check every descriptor you want to stream or optionally to automate this, open the browser console (F12) and run:
```js
document.querySelectorAll('label.chakra-checkbox:not([data-checked])').forEach(l => l.click());
```
In Google Chrome, open the console (F12) and manually type `allow pasting` and then paste this:
``` js
function pierceShadow(root) {
  const selectors = [
    'input[type="checkbox"]:not(:checked)',
    'label.chakra-checkbox:not([data-checked])',
    '[role="checkbox"][aria-checked="false"]'
  ];
  selectors.forEach(selector => {
    root.querySelectorAll(selector).forEach(el => {
      console.log('Clicking:', el);
      el.click();
    });
  });
  root.querySelectorAll('*').forEach(el => {
    if (el.shadowRoot) {
      pierceShadow(el.shadowRoot);
    }
  });
}
pierceShadow(document);
```

   - If you want the "Predicted SOC" helper sensor to work, make sure your telematics container includes the descriptors `vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.header`, `vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.maxEnergy`, `vehicle.powertrain.electric.battery.charging.power`, and `vehicle.drivetrain.electricEngine.charging.status`. Those fields let the integration reset the predicted state of charge and calculate the charging slope between stream updates. It seems like the `vehicle.drivetrain.batteryManagement.maxEnergy` always gets sent even though it's not explicitly set, but check it anyway.

9. Save the selection.
10. Repeat for all the cars you want to support
11. In Home Assistant, install this integration via HACS (see below under Installation (HACS)) and still in Home Assistant, step trough the Configuration Flow also described here below.
12. During the Home Assistant config flow, paste the client ID, visit the provided verification URL, enter the code (if asked), and approve. **Do not click Continue/Submit in Home Assistant until the BMW page confirms the approval**; submitting early leaves the flow stuck and requires a restart.
13. **If you get Error 500 during setup:**
    
    **Immediate actions:**
    - ❌ Remove the integration from Home Assistant
    - 🔄 Go to BMW portal → Delete current Client ID
    - ⏱️ **Wait 5 minutes** (BMW backend needs to clear old session)
    - ✅ Create new Client ID
    - ⏱️ **Wait another 2 minutes**
    - ✅ Try installation again
    
    **If error persists after 2-3 attempts:**
    - ⏱️ Wait 24 hours (you may have hit daily rate limit)
    - Try during different time of day (BMW servers less loaded)
14. Wait for the car to send data—triggering an action via the MyBMW app (lock/unlock doors) usually produces updates immediately. (older cars might need a drive before sensors start popping up, idrive6)

## Troubleshooting Setup Errors:

### Error 403 (Forbidden)
**Cause**: Authentication credentials incorrect or permissions not activated

**Solutions**:
1. ✅ Verify `clientid` is from BMW portal (NOT your login email)
2. ✅ Ensure both "CarData API" AND "CarData Stream" are enabled
3. ✅ Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling permissions before trying again
4. ✅ Delete and regenerate Client ID if permissions were recently changed
5. ✅ Check that your BMW account has an active ConnectedDrive subscription

### Error 500 (Server Error)
**Cause**: BMW API temporary issue or rate limiting

**Solutions**:
1. ⏱️ Wait 5-10 minutes before retrying
2. 🔄 Delete integration, create new Client ID in BMW portal
3. 🔄 Try setup during off-peak hours (early morning/late evening)
4. ✅ Ensure you didn't click "Authenticate device" in BMW portal (skip this!)
5. 📧 If persistent, contact BMW CarData support - may be account-specific issue -> bmwcardata-b2c-support@bmwgroup.com

### Error: "Stuck on waiting for approval"
**Cause**: Submitted HA config flow before BMW page confirmed approval

**Solution**:
1. 🛑 Wait for BMW page to show: "Device authenticated successfully"
2. ✅ Only then click "Submit" in Home Assistant
3. If already stuck: Restart Home Assistant and start over

## Installation (HACS)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=kvanbiesen&repository=bmw-cardata-ha&category=integration)

Or:
1. Add this repo to HACS as a **custom repository** (type: Integration).
2. Install "Bmw cardata" from the Custom section.
3. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration Flow

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration** and pick **Bmw cardata**.
2. Enter your CarData **client ID** (created in the BMW portal and seen under section CARDATA API and there copied to your clipboard).
3. The flow displays a `verification_url` and `user_code`. Open the link, enter the code, and approve the device.
4. Once the BMW portal confirms the approval, return to HA and click Submit. If you accidentally submit before finishing the BMW login, the flow will hang until the device-code exchange times out; cancel it and start over after completing the BMW login.
5. If you remove the integration later, you can re-add it with the same client ID—the flow deletes the old entry automatically.
6. Small tip, on newer cars with Idrive7, you can force the sensor creation by opening the BMW/Mini App and press lock doors; on older ones like idrive6, You have to start the car, maybe even drive it a little bit

### Reauthorization
If BMW rejects the token (e.g. because the portal revoked it), please use the Configure > Start Device Authorization Again tool

When BMW refuses the stream using tokens it has just issued, the integration reports that instead of asking you to reauthorize, because the credentials are clearly accepted. That usually means something else holds the one stream connection your account gets, so see the custom MQTT broker section below. If nothing else is connected, the client ID is probably missing the `cardata:streaming:read` scope, which does need a new device authorization.

### Custom MQTT Broker (optional)

You can switch the live stream from BMW's MQTT endpoint to your own broker (for example via [bmw-mqtt-bridge](https://dj0abr.github.io/bmw-mqtt-bridge/)).
BMW only accepts one active stream connection per account, so anything else already connected with the same credentials (a second Home Assistant instance, evcc, or a bridge) makes BMW refuse this one with `Not authorized` even though the token is valid. Letting a single bridge consume the BMW stream and pointing every consumer at your own broker avoids that.
BMW authorization is still required; only stream transport changes.
Expected topic format is `<topic_prefix><VIN>` (default prefix `bmw/`) and payload JSON must include `vin` and `data`.
Configure it in Home Assistant via **Settings -> Devices & Services -> BMW CarData -> Configure -> MQTT Broker**.

## Entity Naming & Structure

- Each VIN becomes a device in HA (`VIN` pulled from CarData).
- Sensors/binary sensors are auto-created and named from descriptors (e.g. `Cabin Door Row1 Driver Is Open`).
- The device tracker (location entity) is restored from the entity registry on restart, so it keeps its last known position even before MQTT data arrives.
- Additional attributes include the source timestamp.
- All numeric sensors declare `suggested_display_precision`, so unit conversions (e.g. km to miles) display clean rounded values in standard HA cards and the built-in vehicle card. You can override the display unit per entity via the gear icon in the entity settings, or switch your HA unit system to imperial for a global change.

## Vehicle Dashboard Card (Lovelace)

The integration automatically registers a built-in Lovelace vehicle card — no manual YAML or HACS frontend install needed.

In Home Assistant:
- Go to a dashboard → **Edit dashboard** → **Add card**
- Search for **BMW CarData Vehicle**
- In the card editor, select which vehicle to display

</p>

Available configuration options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `device_id` | *(required)* | Device ID of the BMW vehicle (from the cardata integration) |
| `license_plate` | *(empty)* | License plate number, shown instead of VIN when set |
| `show_title` | `true` | Vehicle name / card header. Set to `false` to hide it without the flash-of-unstyled-content you get from hiding it via card-mod. |
| `soc_source` | `soc` | Battery level source for the bar: `soc` (BMW last known), `predicted` (charging prediction), or `magic` (driving prediction) |
| `show_indicators` | `true` | Status indicator row (locks, doors, windows, alarm). Windows, tailgate, and hood only show red when the car is parked and locked with the item open (walked-away alert). Alarm indicator: green when armed, blue when unarmed, red when triggered. |
| `show_range` | `true` | Battery / fuel level bar with range |
| `show_image` | `true` | Vehicle image |
| `show_map` | `true` | Inline location map |
| `map_height` | `120` | Mini map height in pixels |
| `show_buttons` | `true` | Quick-info tiles (location, mileage, service) |
| `leasing_entity` | *(empty)* | Sensor entity for the optional leasing section (see below) |
| `leasing_tiles` | `[lease_remaining, monthly_budget, projected, cost]` | Which leasing tiles to show, in order. Available: `lease_remaining`, `monthly_budget`, `monthly_average`, `km_balance`, `driven`, `target`, `total`, `lease_start`, `lease_end`, `projected`, `cost` |
| `language` | `auto` | Card language: `auto` (follow the Home Assistant UI language), `en`, or `de`. Values formatted by Home Assistant (numbers, units, entity states) follow your HA locale regardless. PRs adding languages are welcome — each language is one dictionary block in `bmw-cardata-vehicle-card.js`. |

### Custom Map Marker (optional)

By default, the mini-map (and any other `type: map` card showing the vehicle's
device tracker) renders a plain marker. To use your own picture instead, drop
an image in the same folder the integration already stores the vehicle's
auto-fetched photo:

```
/config/www/community/cardata/<VIN>_marker.png   (or .jpg / .jpeg / .webp)
```

The `_marker` suffix keeps it from colliding with the auto-fetched
`<VIN>.png` vehicle photo — both can coexist. Matching is case-insensitive,
but the VIN must otherwise match exactly (find it on the vehicle's device
page). Restart Home Assistant (or reload the integration) after adding the
file for it to take effect.

If no marker picture is present, the map falls back to the device tracker's
own icon (`mdi:car` by default, or whatever you've customized it to via
Settings → Entities → the device tracker → icon override), and only falls
back further to Home Assistant's default abbreviated-text marker if neither
is set.

### Leasing Section (optional)

Set `leasing_entity` to a sensor that tracks your lease. The card then shows
leasing tiles — by default: remaining lease time, the remaining average
distance per month allowed by the contract, projected over/under mileage at
lease end, and the projected cost/refund. Which tiles appear (and their
order) is configurable via `leasing_tiles`; additional tiles are available
for the monthly average so far, today's balance vs. pro-rata target, total
distance driven, and today's target. The card only displays — all math lives
in the sensor.

Over-mileage and costs render in the error color, under-mileage and refunds in
the success color. Missing attributes show "—". Distances use the sensor's
`unit_of_measurement` (falls back to km); the cost tile uses your Home
Assistant currency. Tapping any tile opens the sensor's more-info dialog with
all details.

#### Setup with the Lease Mileage Tracker blueprint

The section is built against the sensor contract of the
[Lease Mileage Tracker](https://github.com/elmars/ha-leasing-blueprint)
template blueprint (requires Home Assistant 2024.10+) — the quickest way to
get a conforming sensor:

1. Import the blueprint:

   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the blueprint import dialog with a specific blueprint pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/blueprint_import.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Felmars%2Fha-leasing-blueprint%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Flease_mileage.yaml)

   (Template blueprints do not appear on the Blueprints settings page — that
   page only lists automation/script blueprints. The import still works.)

2. Create one sensor per vehicle in your YAML configuration, feeding it the
   mileage sensor this integration provides:

   ```yaml
   template:
     - use_blueprint:
         path: elmars/lease_mileage.yaml
         input:
           name: "Lease My BMW"
           unique_id: lease_my_bmw
           odometer: sensor.my_bmw_mileage   # mileage sensor from this integration
           start_date: "2024-12-18"
           end_date: "2027-12-18"
           total_distance: 75000
           excess_rate: 0.40      # per km/mi over, incl. VAT
           shortfall_rate: 0.25   # per km/mi under, incl. VAT
           excess_allowance: 1500
           shortfall_allowance: 1500
   ```

   Then reload template entities (Developer tools → YAML → Template entities).

3. Point the card at the sensor — via the GUI editor ("Leasing sensor
   (optional)") or in YAML:

   ```yaml
   type: custom:bmw-cardata-vehicle-card
   device_id: abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
   leasing_entity: sensor.lease_my_bmw
   ```

#### Sensor contract (for custom sensors)

Any sensor works as long as it follows the blueprint's contract: the sensor
**state** is the projected over/under mileage at lease end (positive = over,
used by the `projected` tile), and each tile reads one attribute — only the
attributes of the tiles you enable are required:

| Tile | Attribute | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `lease_remaining` | `days_remaining` / `months_remaining` | Remaining lease time |
| `monthly_budget` | `monthly_remaining` | Remaining average distance per month allowed by the contract |
| `monthly_average` | `monthly_average` | Average distance per month so far |
| `km_balance` | `deviation` | Actual distance minus pro-rata target today |
| `driven` | `actual` | Distance driven since lease start |
| `target` | `target` | Pro-rata target distance as of today |
| `total` | `total_distance` | Total contract distance allowance |
| `lease_start` / `lease_end` | `lease_start` / `lease_end` | Contract start / end date (shown in the card language's date format) |
| `cost` | `projected_cost` | Projected cost (positive) or refund (negative) at lease end, in your HA currency |

### YAML Configuration

You can also add the card manually in YAML. The card type is `custom:bmw-cardata-vehicle-card`.

To find the `device_id`, go to **Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData**, click on a vehicle device, and copy the device ID from the URL (the hex string after `/config/devices/device/`).

Minimal example:

```yaml
type: custom:bmw-cardata-vehicle-card
device_id: abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
```

Full example with all options:

```yaml
type: custom:bmw-cardata-vehicle-card
device_id: abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
license_plate: AB 123 CD
show_title: true
soc_source: predicted
show_indicators: true
show_range: true
show_image: true
show_map: true
map_height: 120
show_buttons: true
leasing_entity: sensor.leasing_mini
```

To hide the map and quick-info tiles:

```yaml
type: custom:bmw-cardata-vehicle-card
device_id: abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890
show_map: false
show_buttons: false
```

## Debug Logging
Detailed MQTT and auth logs are off by default. Turn them on the usual Home Assistant way, either from **Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData → Enable debug logging**, or by adding this to `configuration.yaml` and restarting:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.cardata: debug
```

Remember to turn it off again once you have captured what you need, since the output is verbose.

For development there is also `DEBUG_LOG` in `custom_components/cardata/const.py`. Setting it to `True` forces debug logging on regardless of the Home Assistant configuration, and additionally lets entity update failures propagate instead of being logged and swallowed.

## Predicted SOC with Learning

The integration includes a predicted SOC (State of Charge) sensor that estimates battery charge during charging sessions. This sensor uses real-time accumulated energy (trapezoidal integration of charging power minus auxiliary consumption) to calculate charging progress more frequently than BMW's native SOC updates. This handles varying power levels naturally (DC taper above 80%, cold-battery ramp-up, grid fluctuations).

### Vehicles Without Power Telemetry

Some older models (e.g. i3s, iDrive 6 cars) do not report charging power or voltage/current via MQTT. For these vehicles, the integration derives an implied charging power from BMW SOC changes: when an API poll delivers a higher SOC than the previous anchor and no real power data exists, the average power is back-calculated from the SOC delta, elapsed time, and default efficiency. The heartbeat then extrapolates between polls using this derived value, giving smooth SOC progression instead of staircase jumps every 30 minutes. Real power data (if it arrives later) overwrites the derived value automatically.

### Charging Phases

For AC charging the power is worked out from the voltage and current BMW reports, multiplied by the number of phases in use. BMW resets `phaseNumber` to `1-PHASES` when a charge ends and reports the real count when the next charge starts, so a reading older than the start of the charge now running says nothing about it and is discarded. The cable is no help in telling the two apart, since BMW re-stamps the charge port as connected at every start and stop without it ever moving. A count above one is allowed ten seconds of lead on that start, because a vehicle sending the count over the stream can stamp it a moment ahead of the status it belongs to, and BMW's reset is always a single phase so nothing reading higher can be it. Until something better arrives the charge is modelled at a single phase.

Some vehicles never send `phaseNumber` over the stream and only report it when the API is asked. A charge that starts without a count for itself is therefore given a minute and then polled once, which is when the value BMW writes at the start of a charge is picked up. This poll deliberately ignores the trip-end cooldown, since a poll taken before the charge began cannot carry its phase count and blocking on one would drop the request for nothing, which is exactly what happens on arriving home and plugging in. It has its own cooldown of an hour per vehicle instead, so a wallbox switching on and off cannot spend the day's calls on this.

A count left over from an earlier charge is not simply thrown away. BMW resets `phaseNumber` to `1-PHASES` at the end of a charge, so a leftover of one says nothing, but anything higher was reported while a real charge was running, most likely at the same wallbox, and is a better opening guess than assuming a single phase. It is held as the integration's own rather than as BMW's, so the measurement below can take it back when this charge turns out to be a different supply.

If BMW stays silent, the battery itself gives the answer away. Inverting the model against the energy actually stored says how many phases the charge would have needed, measured over a window of at least 8% SOC gain. Because whole-percent SOC steps can carry a single window over the line, two consecutive windows have to agree before the count is raised to three.

Raising the count is the risky direction, so withdrawing one is deliberately easier: a single window is enough, and the withdrawal re-anchors the prediction to the BMW reading that disproved it. Putting only the phase count back would fix the rate while leaving the level, since during a charge the prediction never comes down of its own accord, so an inflated value would stay on screen for hours.

Anything BMW reports for the charge now running always wins over an inferred value, and a session whose phase count changed partway through is excluded from efficiency learning, since its energy was integrated under two different assumptions.

The inference deliberately holds back where the evidence is not clear cut, in which case the charge simply stays modelled at one phase as before:

- Vehicles reporting a line-to-line voltage (250 V and above), where the wiring convention behind the power formula cannot be confirmed
- The last few percent before the target, where the current tapers and the SOC no longer tracks the energy going in
- Charges below roughly 75% efficiency, which no longer stand out clearly enough
- Two-phase charging, which lands between the thresholds and so stays understated rather than being overstated as three
- Any session fed by an external power meter, since injected power is not scaled by the phase count and makes the energy unusable as evidence
- Windows containing a long gap in the energy integration, which leaves the modelled side short while the SOC gain over the same period counts in full
- A battery capacity set by hand that BMW's own reported figure contradicts by more than 20%, since the result scales directly with it
- Plug-in hybrids, which almost never have a three-phase charger

The `Charging Efficiency Matrix` sensor, which is hidden by default and can be enabled in the device settings, reports `phases_source` alongside `phases`: whether the count was `reported` by BMW, `carried` over from an earlier charge, `derived` from the energy, or merely `assumed`, so a count the integration worked out is never mistaken for one BMW gave. The charging phases sensor itself only ever repeats what BMW reports and is not written by any of this.

### Charges BMW Never Ends

BMW pushes the end of a charge over the stream when it feels like it, and on some vehicles never at all. The predicted SOC then keeps climbing on modelled power alone until the next scheduled poll, which on a multi-car setup can be hours away, and the sensor reads high the whole time.

Two independent signs that a charge is over are each worth one API call to settle: BMW's own estimate of the time left, which arrives with every poll, has run out, or the prediction has reached the charge target and has nothing left to add. Whichever comes first, the integration asks the API once whether the charge is still running and lets the answer end the session. The question is asked once per charge, so a charge BMW insists is still running costs a single call rather than one every heartbeat.

### How Learning Works

The predicted SOC sensor automatically learns your vehicle's charging efficiency:

- **AC charging efficiency**: Starts at 90%, learns per charging condition (phases, voltage, current)
- **DC charging efficiency**: Starts at 93%, learns from actual DC sessions
- Both AC and DC use the same **efficiency matrix** with per-condition outlier detection, history tracking, and trend analysis
- Uses **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** with adaptive learning rate (converges fast initially, settles to 20%)
- Learning data persists across Home Assistant restarts
- Active charging sessions and pending sessions survive HA restarts (restored sessions skip learning to avoid polluted data from energy gaps)
- After HA restart, stale SOC data from previous sessions is detected and rejected using BMW-provided timestamps, preventing false re-anchoring of the predicted SOC
- Session-level SOC and energy tracking survives mid-session re-anchoring, so learning uses the full session data even when BMW SOC corrections occurred during charging

### Learning Requirements

For learning to occur, a charging session must meet these criteria:
- Minimum 5% SOC gain during the session
- Calculated efficiency between 40% and 98% (outliers are rejected)
- Per-condition outlier detection (2-sigma after 5+ history entries for the same charging condition)
- Valid power data recorded throughout the session

### Session Finalization

Learning happens when a charging session ends:
- **Target reached**: If charging stops within 2% of the target SOC, learning happens immediately
- **Charge interrupted**: If stopped before target, waits for BMW SOC confirmation:
  - DC charging: 5-minute grace period
  - AC charging: 15-minute grace period

### PHEV-Specific Behavior

For Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), the predicted SOC has special handling:

- **Automatic PHEV detection**: Vehicles with both an HV battery and fuel system are detected as PHEVs, unless metadata (driveTrain/propulsionType) or the model name (e.g. i4, iX, i5) identifies them as a known BEV
- **Sync down on battery depletion**: If the actual BMW SOC is lower than the predicted value, the prediction syncs down immediately. This handles scenarios where the hybrid system depletes the battery (e.g., battery recovery mode, engine-priority driving)
- **Header filtering during charging**: When `charging.level` is available and fresh, `batteryManagement.header` is only allowed through if it would sync UP (header above prediction). Stale header values frozen at the pre-charge level are always below the prediction and get blocked, while legitimate mid-charge header updates above the prediction are allowed through for re-anchoring
- **Charging level ignored for sync-down**: During charging, `charging.level` (BMW's own prediction) is ignored when lower than our energy-based prediction, which tracks the real battery more accurately
- **BEVs**: For pure electric vehicles, the predicted SOC only syncs when not actively charging (standard behavior)

This ensures the predicted SOC stays accurate for PHEVs even when the hybrid system uses battery power in ways that don't register as "discharging" in the BMW API.

**Charging prediction accuracy**: On PHEVs with small batteries, you may notice a small step (typically 2-3 percentage points) at the end of charge when BMW's real SOC arrives and syncs up with the energy-based prediction. Small batteries amplify any efficiency estimation error because each kWh represents a larger percentage of total capacity. This is normal. Charging efficiency varies between sessions due to temperature, charge depth, and grid voltage fluctuations, so the learned EMA efficiency cannot perfectly predict each individual session. The step is largest during the first 5-10 sessions for a given charging configuration (phases, voltage, current) and shrinks as the EMA converges, but some residual variation is expected even after 20+ sessions. On BEVs with larger batteries the same absolute error translates to a much smaller percentage step. The prediction tracks the real battery closely throughout charging and the sync-up at the end ensures the final value is always accurate.

### Reset Buttons

Each EV/PHEV vehicle gets button entities to reset learned data:
- **Reset AC Learning**: Clears all AC entries from the efficiency matrix (resets to default 90%)
- **Reset DC Learning**: Clears all DC entries from the efficiency matrix (resets to default 93%)
- **Reset Magic Learning**: Clears driving consumption learning (resets to model default). Only appears when Magic SOC is enabled.

These buttons appear in the vehicle's device page under Configuration entities.

### Manual Battery Capacity

Each EV/PHEV vehicle gets a **Manual Battery Capacity** number entity (disabled by default) under Configuration entities. When set to a value above 0, it overrides the automatic capacity detection (BMW `maxEnergy` / `batterySizeMax`) for both charging and driving SOC prediction. Useful when BMW reports incorrect capacity values. Set to 0 to return to automatic detection.

### Manual Tank Capacity

Vehicles with fuel data get a **Manual Tank Capacity** number entity (disabled by default) under Configuration entities. When set to a value above 0 (in litres), the vehicle card computes a fuel level percentage from the remaining fuel and displays a progress bar. Useful for vehicles where BMW does not send `fuelSystem.level` (the percentage descriptor) and only sends `remainingFuel` (absolute litres). Set to 0 to disable.

## Magic SOC — Driving Consumption Prediction (Experimental)

Magic SOC predicts battery drain during driving using real-time odometer distance and learned consumption rates. It provides a sub-integer SOC estimate that updates more frequently than BMW's native integer SOC. **Disabled by default** — enable via Settings.

- **Enable via**: Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData → Configure → Settings → Enable Magic SOC
- **Sensor**: `vehicle.magic_soc` per vehicle (BEV only; PHEVs get passthrough BMW SOC)
- **How it works**: Anchors on BMW's reported SOC at trip start, then subtracts `distance × learned_consumption / capacity` as the vehicle drives. Re-anchors when BMW sends a fresh SOC mid-drive — if the drift is < 0.5pp, keeps the sub-integer prediction for smoother display.
- **Consumption learning**: Uses EMA (Exponential Moving Average) with adaptive rate. Default 0.21 kWh/km globally, with per-model defaults (e.g. i4 eDrive40 = 0.18 kWh/km). Learns from completed trips where both SOC drop and distance are available. Requires at least 5 trips before the learning rate settles to 20%.
- **Trip detection**: Combines BMW's `isMoving` signal, GPS-derived motion, and odometer changes. Handles MQTT bursts and GPS gaps gracefully.
- **Capacity**: Uses live `maxEnergy` from BMW (reflects real degradation), falls back to `batterySizeMax`, then to per-model defaults.
- **Reset**: A "Reset Magic Learning" button appears under Configuration entities for each BEV.

**Limitations**: This is experimental. Accuracy depends on BMW sending timely SOC and mileage data. Preheating, extended idle with accessories, and firmware glitches can cause temporary inaccuracy. PHEVs are excluded from prediction (hybrid powertrain makes distance-based estimation unreliable).

## External Power Meter Injection (Optional)

If you have a smart meter that reports the power delivered to the car, you can feed its readings into the SOC predictor and bypass BMW's V×A telemetry, which is refreshed only every ~5 hours on some models and returns sentinel zero values during fast EVSE flapping (see discussion [#359](https://github.com/kvanbiesen/bmw-cardata-ha/discussions/359)). It is also the recommended setup if you stop the EVSE externally (e.g. a Home Assistant automation cutting the wallbox), since BMW's backend can keep reporting `CHARGING` with stale power for some time after the actual stop and the predictor will keep extrapolating from the last known power. Feeding 0 W from the meter at stop time anchors the prediction to ground truth. **Disabled by default.**

- **Enable via**: Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData → Configure → Settings → Use external power meter for charging
- **Service**: `cardata.update_charging_power` with fields `vin`, `power_kw`, and optional `aux_power_kw`.
- **Precedence**: Freshness-based. While a local reading has arrived within the last 120 seconds, BMW-sourced V×A and `charging.power` updates are suppressed. When local readings stop (car driven away, meter offline), the predictor falls back to BMW after the timeout — no manual switching needed.
- **Typical setup**: A Home Assistant automation that triggers on your meter's power sensor changes (or on a 10–30 second interval) and calls the service with the current reading. **Gate the automation on the car being home** — otherwise the meter will happily push 0 W while the car is away at a public charger, holding the freshness gate and blocking BMW's V×A updates from the public session.

```yaml
automation:
  - trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.my_ev_meter_power
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: device_tracker.my_bmw
        state: home
    action:
      - service: cardata.update_charging_power
        data:
          vin: "WBY31AW090FP15359"
          power_kw: "{{ states('sensor.my_ev_meter_power') | float / 1000 }}"
```

When the option is disabled, the service no-ops with a warning — leaving it always registered so automations do not break across reloads.

## Charging History (Optional)

The integration can fetch your BMW charging session history from the past 30 days. This is **disabled by default** to conserve your API quota.

- **Enable via**: Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData → Configure → Settings → Enable Charging History
- **API cost**: 1 call per vehicle per day (from your 50-call daily quota)
- **Sensor**: Creates a diagnostic sensor per vehicle showing session count and last charge date
- **Attributes**: Summarised session data (start/end time, start/end SOC, energy consumed, charging duration, mileage, time zone, preconditioning flag). Full raw data available via the `cardata.fetch_charging_history` service
- **Manual trigger**: Use `cardata.fetch_charging_history` service in Developer Tools

## Tyre Diagnosis (Optional)

The integration can fetch tyre health and wear data from BMW's Smart Maintenance system. This is **disabled by default** to conserve your API quota.

- **Enable via**: Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData → Configure → Settings → Enable Tyre Diagnosis
- **API cost**: 1 call per vehicle per day (from your 50-call daily quota)
- **Sensor**: Creates a diagnostic sensor per vehicle showing aggregate tyre status
- **Attributes**: Per-wheel data including dimension, wear, season, manufacturer, defect status, and production date
- **Manual trigger**: Use `cardata.fetch_tyre_diagnosis` service in Developer Tools

## Developer Tools Services

Home Assistant's Developer Tools expose helper services for manual API checks:

- `cardata.fetch_telematic_data` fetches the current contents of the configured telematics container for a VIN and logs the raw payload. Called without a VIN it fetches every known vehicle, and skips any whose data already arrived in the last five minutes, whether over the stream or from an earlier poll, so repeated calls cannot empty the daily quota.
- `cardata.fetch_vehicle_mappings` calls `GET /customers/vehicles/mappings` and logs the mapping details (including PRIMARY or SECONDARY status). Only primary mappings return data; some vehicles do not support secondary users, in which case the mapped user is considered the primary one.
- `cardata.fetch_basic_data` calls `GET /customers/vehicles/{vin}/basicData` to retrieve static metadata (model name, series, etc.) for the specified VIN.
- `cardata.fetch_charging_history` fetches the last 30 days of charging sessions for a VIN. Uses 1 API call per vehicle.
- `cardata.fetch_tyre_diagnosis` fetches tyre health and wear data for a VIN. Uses 1 API call per vehicle.
- `cardata.fetch_vehicle_images` manually fetches vehicle images for all configured vehicles.
- `cardata.clean_hv_containers` lists or deletes high-voltage battery telemetry containers (actions: `list`, `delete`, `delete_all`, `delete_all_matching`).
- `cardata.migrate_entity_ids` migrates entity IDs from old format to new format. Use `dry_run` to preview changes without applying them.
- `cardata.update_charging_power` injects a locally measured charging power reading (kW) into the SOC predictor. Requires the **Use external power meter for charging** option to be enabled under Settings. Intended for users with a smart meter who want to feed accurate real-time power into the prediction instead of relying on BMW's V×A — see the section below.

## API Quota and MQTT Streaming

BMW imposes a **50 calls/day** limit on the CarData API. This integration does not enforce the limit client-side — BMW's own 429 response is respected via backoff. API usage is minimized through MQTT freshness gating and rate limiting:

- **MQTT Stream (real-time)**: The MQTT stream is unlimited and provides real-time updates for events like door locks, motion state, charging power, etc. GPS coordinates are paired using BMW payload timestamps (same GPS fix detection) with an arrival-time fallback, so location updates work even when latitude and longitude arrive in separate MQTT messages. In direct BMW mode, token refresh during MQTT reconnection is lock-free to avoid blocking the connection, and the MQTT connection is proactively reconnected with fresh credentials to prevent session expiry (~1 hour).
- **Telling a quiet car from a dead stream**: the CarData Debug Device carries `Last Message Received`, `Last Telematics API Call` and `Stream Connection Status`. Only real stream messages write the first and the third of those, so a car that has merely gone quiet shows a recent API call next to an older message, while a stream that has died keeps the status it failed with instead of being painted green by the next poll.
- **Trip-end polling**: When a vehicle stops moving (trip ends), the integration triggers an immediate API poll to capture post-trip battery state. This ensures SOC is updated even when the MQTT stream only delivers GPS/mileage but not SOC (common on some models). A configurable per-VIN cooldown (default 10 minutes) prevents GPS burst flapping from burning API quota. A 30-second grace period after door unlock prevents brief intermediate stops (e.g. picking up a passenger) from fragmenting a trip and wasting API calls. Trip-end polling can be **disabled entirely** or the cooldown can be **increased** via Settings → Devices & Services → BMW CarData → Configure → Settings. Disabling it is useful for vehicles making many short trips (e.g. delivery drivers, nurses) that would otherwise exhaust the daily API quota.
- **Charge-end polling**: When charging completes or stops, the integration triggers an immediate API poll to get the actual BMW SOC for learning calibration of the predicted SOC sensor, subject to the same per-VIN cooldown.
- **Charge-finish polling**: Some vehicles never report the end of a charge over the stream, which leaves the predicted SOC climbing until the next scheduled poll. When BMW's own estimate of the time left runs out, or the prediction reaches the charge target, the integration asks once whether the charge is still running. At most one call per charge, and no more than one an hour per vehicle.
- **Charge-start polling**: BMW resets the AC phase count when a charge ends and reports the real one when the next charge starts, and some vehicles only ever send it in response to an API call. When a charge starts without a phase count for that charge, the integration polls once a minute later. This one is not subject to the trip-end cooldown, which would otherwise swallow it whenever a car is plugged in shortly after arriving home; it has its own cooldown of an hour per vehicle. Charges whose phase count is already known, and DC charges, poll nothing.
- **Fallback polling**: The integration polls periodically as a fallback in case MQTT stream fails or after Home Assistant restarts. Each VIN is judged on its own, and only VINs whose last poll is older than the staleness threshold are fetched, so in multi-car setups the fresh ones consume no API calls.
- **Daily optional features**: When Charging History and/or Tyre Diagnosis are enabled, each makes exactly 1 API call per vehicle per day regardless of whether the call succeeds or fails (no retries). The polling interval automatically increases to compensate — e.g. with both features on 2 cars, polling stretches from 2h to 2.4h per VIN.
- **Multi-VIN setups**: All vehicles share the same 50 call/day limit. The poll interval scales with VIN count plus any enabled daily features. Each VIN is guaranteed at least 1 poll per day; BMW's 429 backoff handles actual quota enforcement.
- **Rate limiting**: If BMW returns a rate-limited response (HTTP 429 or HTTP 403 with `CU-429` error code), the integration backs off automatically with exponential delay (1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, up to 24h). Because the quota resets at midnight UTC, a backoff that would run past the reset is shortened to end at it, so API calls resume as soon as the quota is back instead of sitting out the rest of a long backoff. A `Retry-After` header sent by BMW is honoured as-is.

## Requirements

- BMW CarData account with streaming access (CarData API + CarData Streaming subscribed in the portal).
- Client ID created in the BMW portal (see "BMW Portal Setup").
- Home Assistant 2025.3+.
- TLS 1.3 capable SSL library (required for direct BMW MQTT mode): OpenSSL 1.1.1+, LibreSSL 3.2.0+, or equivalent.
- Familiarity with BMW's CarData documentation: https://bmw-cardata.bmwgroup.com/customer/public/api-documentation/Id-Introduction

## !! Recommended setup with people on multiple BMWs (not required, it's working as is but you're limiting yourself in accuracy since the hardcoded 50 limits a day) !!
- Car 1 -> email_1
- Car 2 -> mail_2
- .....
- Use those separate accounts in the integration
- Use mail_x+1 which has all the cars merged for the BMW app

## Translations

The setup wizard, error messages, and options menu are translated into the following languages:

- English (en)
- German (de)
- French (fr)
- Italian (it)
- Dutch (nl)

## Known Limitations

- Direct BMW MQTT has one-stream-per-GCID behavior: make sure no other direct clients are connected simultaneously. To share one upstream stream, use a bridge + custom MQTT broker mode.
- The CarData API is read-only; sending commands remains outside this integration.
- **Premature Continue in auth flow: If you hit Continue before authorizing on BMW's site, the device-code flow gets stuck. Cancel the flow and restart the integration (or Home Assistant) once you've completed the BMW login.**
- **Older models (i3, i3s, iDrive 6 cars, older F-series)**: These vehicles send telemetry very infrequently — typically only when the car is stopped/turned off and when charging reaches 100%. There are no real-time MQTT updates while charging or driving, so most sensors will appear stale between events. The Predicted SOC sensor can help during charging, but accuracy depends on receiving at least an initial SOC value. This is a BMW platform limitation, not a bug in the integration.
- **Neue Klasse (NK/NA5) vehicles**: BMW's CarData API does not provide `batteryManagement.header` or `charging.level` for NK vehicles. The integration uses `stateOfCharge.displayed` as the primary SOC source, with `trip...hvSoc` (trip-end battery level) as a last resort. `stateOfCharge.displayed` updates via API polls but may not refresh in real-time during driving. Charging prediction works via `charging.power`. NK cars also report a fixed placeholder of 2777774 kWh/100km for `avgElectricRangeConsumption`, against the 0-100 kWh/100km that BMW's own data catalogue declares; readings outside a documented range are dropped, so the average consumption sensor stays absent on these vehicles rather than showing a nonsense number.
